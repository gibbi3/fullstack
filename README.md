What does this program do?:

This program is designed so that users may input the wins and losses of a
Swiss-style tournament and receive the resulting standings and matchups.

How can it be implemented?

First, a database titled "tournament" must be created, and the appropriate
tables must be imported using "\i tournament.sql". This will ensure the
functions included in "tourament.py" may operate correctly. The functions
therein can then be utilized either through a terminal, or through a program.
